# CRDC Semantic Web Ontology for the Web of Open and Linked Data

## Canadian Research and Development Classification Ontology for the Linked Open Data

This ontology is the result of the transformation of open data in CSV format from the [Canadian Research and Development Classification (CRDC) 2020 Version 1.0](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/crdc/2020v1/index)

### About CRDC 2020 Version 1.0

The Canadian Research and Development Classification (CRDC) was developed conjointly 
by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), 
the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), 
the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI),the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), 
and Statistics Canada which is the custodian.This shared standard classification, inspired by the 
Frascati Model 2015 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 
will be used by the federal granting agencies and Statistics Canada to 
collect and disseminate data related to research and development in Canada. 
The CRDC first official version is the 2020 version 1.0 and it is composed of 3 main pieces: 

1. the type of activity or TOA (with 3 categories), 
2. the field of research or FOR (with 1663 fields at the lowest level) 
3. the socioeconomic objective or SEO (with 85 main groups at the lowest level).

### Goal of the CRDC-CCRD ontology

The CRDC-CCRD ontology aims to offer a bilingual (French/English) and interoperable version for publication on the Wed of linked open data of the CRDC-CCRD vocabulary.  

### The RCDC-CCRD ontology features
The CRDC-CCRD ontology has the following characteristics:

1. The CRDC-CCRD is described with the Resource Description Framework ([RDF]((https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/)), its Schema [RDF Schema 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf-schema-20140225/) as well as [OWL 2 Web Ontology Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/) which are languages recommended by the W3C
2. The CRDC-CCRD is a complete ontological symbolization (class, property, individual, classification and taxonomy) of the content of all the CSV files of the [CCRD (French)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/fra/sujets/norme/ccrd/2020v1/indice) and [CRDC (English)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/crdc/2020v1/index) sites.  
3. All three CRDC-CCRD sub-domains (TDA/TAO, DDR/FOR, OSE/SEO) are accessible from a single file (`crdc-ccrd.ttl`)
4. The CRDC-CCRD data classification semantics is expressed in the file (`crdc-ccrd-semantic.ttl`)
5. The CDRC-CCRD format allows the use of the interoperable query language [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) recommended by the W3C
6. Once published in a web data server, the CRDC-CCRD becomes a component of the web of open and linked data

# 2 CRDC-CCRD taxonomic nomenclature

## 2-1 The crdc-ccrd.ttl graph

### 2-1-1 Classes

The CRDC-CCRD data is classified into four levels:

- 1 Division
- 2 Group
- 3 Class
- 4 Sub-classe

In the `crdc-ccrd-data` graph each top level group is a super class of the bottom level

example:

- for :RDF20-21 at level 1
- for :RDF201 at level 2
- for :RDF20101 at level 3
- for :RDF2010101 at level 4

we have the following taxonomy:

```
:RDF20-21
  rdf:type crdc_ccrd:CRDC_CCRD_Division ;
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:label "Engineering and technology"@en-CA ;
  crdc_ccrd:hasLevel "1"^^xsd:double ;
  rdfs:subClassOf crdc_ccrd:FOR_DDR_Entity .

:RDF201
  rdf:type crdc_ccrd:CRDC_CCRD_Group ;
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  crdc_ccrd:hasLevel "2"^^xsd:double ;
  rdfs:label "Civil engineering, maritime engineering, transport engineering, and mining engineering"@en-CA ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :RDF20-21 .

:RDF20101
  rdf:type crdc_ccrd:CRDC_CCRD_Class ;
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  crdc_ccrd:hasLevel "3"^^xsd:double ;
  rdfs:label "Civil engineering"@en-CA ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :RDF201 .

:RDF2010101
  rdf:type crdc_ccrd:CRDC_CCRD_SubClass ;
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  crdc_ccrd:hasLevel "4"^^xsd:double ;
  rdfs:label "Geotechnical engineering"@en-CA ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :RDF20101 .

``` 

### 2-1-2 Ontological individuals

Each class level has associated elements. The elements are associated to the class by the `rdf:type` predicate

example:

Element `RDF1030507.183 (Compound semiconductors)` is type of `RDF1030507 (Superconductivity)` and the following is the synthesized representation in TURTLE notation:

```
:RDF1030507.183
  rdf:type :RDF1030507 ;
  rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual ;
  rdfs:label "compound semiconductors (See RDF2060103 Compound semiconductors)"@en-CA ;
  rdfs:label "semiconducteurs composés (Voir RDF2060103 Semi-conducteurs composés)"@fr-CA .

:RDF1030507
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdf:type crdc_ccrd:CRDC_CDDR_SubClass ;
  crdc_ccrd:hasLevel "4"^^xsd:double ;
  rdfs:label "Superconductivity"@en-CA ;
  rdfs:label "Supraconductivité"@fr-CA ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :RDF10305 .

```

# 3 Usage

The `ccrd-crdc.ttl` graph can be used alone. However, it is better to use it with `crdc-ccrd-semantic.ttl` since it is imported by `ccrd-crdc.ttl`.

# 4 Creation procedure of ccrd-crdc.ttl

The execution of this procedure is not mandatory since the `ccrd-crdc.ttl` file is already generated.

#### A) Importing CSV files from the 
[CRDC-CCRD](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/crdc/2020v1/index)

in the directory [src/main/resources/csv](src/main/resources/csv) import the sfollowing files:

- wget https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/statistical-programs/document/crdc-ccrd-2020-toa-tda-structure-eng.csv
- wget https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/statistical-programs/document/crdc-ccrd-2020-for-ddr-structure-eng.csv
- wget https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/statistical-programs/document/crdc-ccrd-2020-for-ddr-element-eng.csv
- wget https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/statistical-programs/document/crdc-ccrd-2020-seo-ose-structure-eng.csv
- wget https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/statistical-programs/document/crdc-ccrd-2020-seo-ose-element-eng.csv
- wget https://www.statcan.gc.ca/fra/programmes-statistiques/document/crdc-ccrd-2020-toa-tda-structure-fra.csv
- wget https://www.statcan.gc.ca/fra/programmes-statistiques/document/crdc-ccrd-2020-for-ddr-structure-fra.csv
- wget https://www.statcan.gc.ca/fra/programmes-statistiques/document/crdc-ccrd-2020-for-ddr-element-fra.csv
- wget https://www.statcan.gc.ca/fra/programmes-statistiques/document/crdc-ccrd-2020-seo-ose-structure-fra.csv
- wget https://www.statcan.gc.ca/fra/programmes-statistiques/document/crdc-ccrd-2020-seo-ose-element-fra.csv

For each first line (titles) of each csv file: remove spaces with the character '_' and replace special characters (e.g. 'é' ) with universal characters ('e')

example for the file `crdc-ccrd-2020-for-ddr-element-eng.csv`

replace :

```
Niveau,Code,Titres de classes,Nom du type d’élément Français,Description d’élément Français

```
by

```
﻿Niveau,Code,Titres_de_classes,Nom_du_type_d_element_Francais,Description_d_element_Francais
```


#### B) Generate the `ccrd-crdc.ttl` file by running the command: 

`mvn -q clean test -Pbuild-ccrd-crdc`

* Note: Make sure you have installed the java-JDK 1.8 and the Maven utility
